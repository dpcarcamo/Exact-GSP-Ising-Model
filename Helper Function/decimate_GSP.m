function [G, D] = decimate_GSP(G0)
    % Input: nxn unweighted adjacency matrix G0 representing a GSP network.
    %
    % Output: Randomly remove nodes of degree 1 or 2. If we remove a node of
    % degree 2 then we place a new edge between the two neighbors of the
    % removed node. Continue this process until no more nodes of degree 1 or 2
    % exist and return the final adjacency matrix G. Also return the order of
    % decimations in the numDec x 3 matrix D, where D(t,1) is the node removed
    % at step t and D(t,2) and D(t,3) are the two nodes from which the node was
    % removed. We note that D(t,3) = 0 if the removed node had degree 1.

    inds = intersect(find(degs <= 2), find(degs >= 1));
